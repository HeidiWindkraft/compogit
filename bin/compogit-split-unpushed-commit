# Approach:
# Check whether there are multiple components in the commit. If not don't do anything.
# Git rebase -i starting with the given commit,
# passing an editor which replaces the "pick" of the given commit by an "edit".
# Determine components of last commit (HEAD) and create commit-messages for all the components.
# git reset HEAD^
# For all components in alphabetical order:
#   compogit-add-all-modified-of-component ${component}
#   git commit -F ${commit_message_of_component}
# git rebase --continue
